    "- Most array problems have a O(n) space brute force solution, but in-placment implementation is usually needed\n",
    "- By using `pivot variables`, arrays can have different partitions (sometime even overlapped), this is specially useful to in-placement implementations. Examples are the even-odd element problem and etc.\n",
    "- For matching/searching in array, optimal solutions usually involve `data structures`, such as trees, sorted array, or hash.\n",
    "- Most array problems can be solved in `O(nlogn)` time, e.g., by sorting it first. If it is an interview question, usually it targets at `O(n)` or even `O(logn)`.\n",
    "- Arrays operate equally efficiently from BOTH ends\n",
    "- When using pivot variables to define the boundary of partitions, I found it useful to define them as [start, end). This asymetry makes it easier to represent empty partitions"
